Create the `plasmapy.analysis` package as per
`PLEP-7 <https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy-PLEPs/blob/master/PLEP-0007.rst>`_ and
initialize the package with the `~plasmapy.analysis.fit_functions` module.  Fit
functions are designed to wrap together an analytical function, a curve fitter,
uncertainty propagation, and a root solver to make curve fitting a little less
painful.
